Worldlog is a PHP based Geo-Location Markup Web Application

Setup:
  * Setup your PHP and Mysql environment (PHP 5 and Mysql 5 maybe).
  * Copy the two folders (worldlog and worldlog_service).
  * Build database by using the scripts in worldlog_service/db.
  * Change test database connection info in worldlog_service/unittests/testdbhelper.php.
  * Change database connection info in worldlog_service/services/dbhelper.php.

About Worldlog Architecture:
  * The communication between front and back end purely rely on XML-RPC.
    In fact, you can replace each individual part, eg. keeping the front end but rewriting back end with RoR.

Front End:
  * Worldlog folder contains the front end of worldlog app.
  * The entry point is index.php.
  * You can visit indexAjaxMock.php before your back end setup.
  * The front end provides several extension points, so that you can extend item types, map types and so on. (details in worldlog/FRONT_END_EXTENSION_GUIDE(CN))

Back End:
  * Worldlog_service folder contains the back end of worldlog app.
  * All test php files in worldlog_service/unittests/daotests and modeltests should display "All test passed.".
    However, I'm so sorry that I'm not sure about the compatible PHP and Mysql version, since the app has been developed too long ago (about 2006)...
  * The services provided by the back end are illustrated in worldlog_service/BACK_END_REQUEST_EXAMPLES.
